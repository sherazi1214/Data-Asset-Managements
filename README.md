### Information Lifecycle

**English:**
Information Lifecycle means the stages through which data passes from creation to deletion.
Main stages:

**Creation** / Collection – Data is generated or collected.

**Storage** – Saved in databases, files, servers.

**Use** / Processing – Accessed by apps, employees, systems.

**Sharing** / Distribution – Sent to users, partners, cloud.

**Retention** / Archiving – Stored for legal or business needs.

**Disposal** / Destruction – Securely deleted or destroyed.

**Urdu:**
Information lifecycle ka matlab hai ke data apni zindagi ke different stages me guzarta hai: create hota hai, use hota hai, store hota hai, share hota hai, retain hota hai aur end me securely delete kar diya jata hai.

## Data Retention

**English:**
Retention means keeping data for a specific period of time (defined by law, regulation, or business policy). Example: banks must keep customer records for 7 years.

**Urdu:**
Data retention ka matlab hai ke data ek fixed period tak rakha jaye, jaise law ya company policy ke mutabiq. Example: bank records 7 saal tak store karte hain.

## Data Archiving

**English:**
**Archiving** = Moving inactive or old data into long-term storage (cheaper, but still accessible if needed).

**Urdu:**
Data archiving ka matlab hai purana ya kam use hone wala data ek safe aur cheap storage me dalna taa ke zarurat par wapas access ho sake.

## Data Legal Hold

**English:**
Legal Hold = When data must be preserved for legal reasons (lawsuit, investigation). Even if retention period is over, data cannot be deleted until case ends.

**Urdu:**
Legal hold ka matlab hai ke data ko law ya court ke order pe preserve karna. Matlab jab tak case khatam na ho, data delete nahi kar sakte.

### Data Deduplication

**English:**
**Deduplication** = Removing duplicate copies of data to save storage.
**Example:** if same file is stored 10 times, dedup keeps only one copy.

**Urdu:**
Data deduplication ka matlab hai duplicate data ko remove karna taa ke storage space save ho.

## Data Remanence

**English:**
Data remanence means residual data that remains on storage media after deletion (like traces of files even after pressing delete). Hackers can recover this if not sanitized.

**Urdu:**
Data remanence ka matlab hai ke delete karne ke baad bhi thoda data media pe bacha rehta hai, jo forensic tools se recover ho sakta hai.

## Data Sanitization

****English:
Sanitization = Securely wiping data so it cannot be recovered.
Methods:

**Overwriting (wiping)** – Write random bits multiple times.

**Degaussing** – Magnetic erase for HDDs/tapes.

**Cryptographic Erase** – Delete encryption keys, making data unreadable.

**Urdu:**
Data sanitization ka matlab hai data ko aise delete karna ke kisi tool se recover na ho sake. Ye overwrite, degauss ya encryption keys delete karke hota hai.

## Media Destruction

**English:**
If sanitization is not enough, then physically destroy storage media (HDDs, SSDs, CDs, tapes) via shredding, crushing, melting, incineration.

**Urdu:**
Media destruction ka matlab hai storage device ko physically destroy karna, jaise shredder se HDD todna ya incineration me jalana.

## Destruction Certificate

**English:**
A destruction certificate is an official document that confirms data/media has been securely destroyed according to standards (ISO, NIST, DoD).

 **Urdu:**
Destruction certificate ek legal proof hota hai jo batata hai ke data ya device ko properly destroy kiya gaya hai aur ab recover nahi ho sakta.

## Summary Flow:

**Lifecycle** = Data from creation → storage → use → retention → deletion.

**Retention** = Keep data for defined period.

**Archiving** = Move old data to long-term storage.

**Legal Hold** = Preserve data for court/investigation.

**Deduplication** = Remove duplicates to save space.

**Remanence** = Residual traces after deletion.

**Sanitization** = Secure wiping (overwrite, degauss, crypto erase).

**Media Destruction** = Physically destroy device.

**Destruction Certificate** = Proof of secure destruction.
